//! `pitboard-probe` measures the Windows facts Pitboard for Windows is built on, on a
//! machine kept for that: the owner's VM sessions and the runner-facts step every Windows CI
//! leg runs. It is never published and never in a release (`publish = false`, and
//! `release.yml` never builds it).
//!
//! The crate is split in two halves, so the half that holds no Windows call is unit tested
//! on every system:
//!
//! - the **report** half, here in the library: the command line, how a logon, an elevation,
//!   a Credential Manager target, a process image or a manifest is named, what the probe
//!   refuses to touch, how it hides the account in what it prints, the PE reader, and the
//!   report's JSON shape. Every piece of it is pure.
//! - the **measure** half, [`win`], compiled on Windows alone. On any other system it is
//!   absent and every subcommand says the probe is for Windows.
//!
//! What the probe may never do is written into the report half, so a test proves it:
//!
//! - every subcommand that writes refuses unless the Windows account carries the throwaway
//!   marker the owner creates, and refuses a scratch path that is relative or lies, in any
//!   spelling, inside the real profile's `.claude`, `.codex` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pitboard`
//!   ([`guard`]);
//! - it writes, reads or deletes only Credential Manager items, tasks, registry keys and
//!   files it made itself under a `pitboard-probe-*` name or in a scratch folder it was
//!   given; `credman-names` asks Credential Manager only for the live login families and
//!   `pitboard-*` names, and never reads a blob out ([`names`]);
//! - it names processes only when they are the tools', their runtimes', Pitboard's, the
//!   probe's or a browser's ([`images`]);
//! - it prints principals as their relation to the token (self, SYSTEM, Administrators,
//!   other), never a SID, and every path with the profile and the account name replaced
//!   ([`redact`]).

// The probe reads the environment on purpose: `PATH`, `USERPROFILE`, `CODEX_HOME` and the
// rest are what the homes and exe-lookup blocks measure, and it is not Pitboard's engine, so
// the workspace rule to read the environment only through `context::Environment` does not
// apply here.

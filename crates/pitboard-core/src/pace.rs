//! How fast a limit is being used, against using it evenly across its window.
//!
//! A share on its own does not say whether it is a problem: 40% of a weekly limit is fine on
//! Saturday and a warning on Monday morning. What does is the share an even use would have
//! reached by then, which is the part of the window gone by, and how far the share used is
//! from it. Every surface asks this module, so the command line, the status line, the app
//! and `--json` say the same thing.
//!
//! Worked out from one reading: the share used, when it was taken, when the window resets,
//! and how long it runs. The pace is the reading's, as of when it was taken: the share it
//! holds was the share then, and set against a later moment it would drift towards under
//! pace for as long as nobody read the limit again, hiding a warning just when the numbers
//! are old. The rate is the window's own since it began, which is the share used over the
//! time gone by, so a limit faster than even always runs out before it resets, counted
//! down to the moment it is told, and one slower always lasts. It used to be a rate taken
//! across fourteen days of readings, through every reset in them, and on one machine it
//! said a weekly limit at 99% had a day and nine hours left when at its own rate it had one.

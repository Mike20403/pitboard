//! The account windows' bookkeeping, apart from any thread, clock or file: which store is
//! whose and the page each window was last on, which windows the app has open and what each
//! loads, which stores go once their account is forgotten, the link waiting for an account,
//! and the downloads. Each app's web code does what this decides and says what happened, so
//! the macOS app's WebKit and the Windows app's WebView2 follow the same rules.
//!
//! From the macOS app's AccountWindows.swift, StoreJanitor.swift (its decisions),
//! WebsiteData.swift's records, LinkInbox.swift, AccountPicker.swift and Downloads.swift, as
//! they were at a3e5ce0, before this moved here.
//!
//! What the windows show follows the accounts shown. What a read says about who is enrolled
//! is acted on wherever a read says it afresh: each read that answered, and what is known
//! read once the account index changed, whether or not reads fail meanwhile and whether or
//! not anything was shown before it. The Swift model told its windows of fewer: not of a read
//! that answered after one that had, saying what was shown, its numbers apart, to the second,
//! and not of the poll's read where nothing was shown before it. Acting on a read that says
//! what the one before said changes nothing, and the poll's read is of the account index
//! every read lists the accounts from. Not acted on: what stands in for a read that failed
//! before anything was shown, the last numbers measured, nor the numbers a session recorded,
//! taken onto what is shown. So a store is deleted only once such a read no longer derives it
//! from any enrolled account, and only where this Pitboard directory recorded it.

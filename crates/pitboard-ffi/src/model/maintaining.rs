//! What the model keeps of this machine rather than its accounts, as MachineModelTests.swift

//! the repair once a launch, renewing now, doctor's checks, the activity log and the
//! `pitboard` a terminal runs, each under its own name in snake case, with what the settings,
//! MachinePane.swift and ActivityPane.swift said of them. The state is driven through
//! `State::apply` by hand over a core the test scripts, and read as `present` makes it on a

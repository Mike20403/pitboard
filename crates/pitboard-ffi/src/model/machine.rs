//! What the model knows of this machine rather than its accounts, as MachineModel.swift held
//! it: the daily renewal schedule and the one change to it under way, what the last renewal
//! came to, doctor's checks, what Pitboard has changed, and the `pitboard` a terminal would
//! run. `State` takes each intent and answer about them, and `present` says them.
//!
//! Opening at login and linking the command line onto the `PATH` with an administrator's
//! password are the app's own, as its system's: once it has linked it, the app sends
//! `Intent::LookForCommandLine`, and the model looks for the command line again.

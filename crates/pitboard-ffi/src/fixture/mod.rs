//! The fixtures: worlds an app launches into in place of the machine it runs on, for its UI
//! tests and for looking at it with nothing real at stake. Either app's debug build launches
//! one by name, and both get the same world, since each is made here once.
//!
//! A world is the real core and the real model over a machine of the fixture's own: its
//! keychain, its vault, its process list and its scheduler in memory, its files in a folder
//! of its own in the temporary directory, Anthropic and OpenAI answering from a script, and
//! every account put there the way a person would have put it, signed in, enrolled, parked
//! and switched, each change logged when it would have been. So a world shows what the core
//! makes of it, and none of the core's rules is written twice. What the fixture plays is
//! only what is outside the core: each tool's own sign-in, the person at the browser, the
//! other apps on the machine, and the services. Nothing a world does reaches this machine's
//! homes, keychain, scheduler or network, and it posts no notification.
//!
//! What is exported is the same in every build, so one set of generated bindings serves a
//! library built with the `fixture` feature and one built without: `PitboardModel::fixture`,
//! `PitboardModel::fixture_in`, `fixture_names` and `fixture_page`. Without the feature no
//! world is compiled at all, and each refuses, naming the feature, or answers that there is
//! none.

//! Each tool's own sign-in on a fixture's machine, played through pitboard-core's seam for a
//! sign-in that starts no program, together with the person at the browser. Everything
//! around it is the real core's: the private directory it reserves, the login it reads back
//! from where the tool stores it there, and the enrolment.
//!
//! Each prints what its tool's register records it printing, and reads what it records it
//! reading. Claude Code's, as `sign_in_output` has 2.1.289, prints that it opens the browser,
//! the address to open where the browser did not, and its prompt for the code the browser
//! shows, and then reads each line typed back, as `sign_in_takes_another_code` has 2.1.289
//! read them: a line that is not `<code>#<state>` with both halves it refuses with its own
//! `Invalid code.` line and reads on, printing no prompt again, and the first line with both
//! halves it takes, whatever its state half says. So a test types a code with its `#`, such
//! as `fixture-code#state`. Codex's, as `codex_login_prints_its_address` has 0.160.0, prints
//! where its loopback server listens and the address to open, reads nothing typed back, and
//! finishes by itself a moment later, once the browser would have come back.
//!
//! Whoever signs in is the person the account is for: one enrolled already under that name
//! signs in again as themselves, and anybody else is somebody new, `<name>@example.com`,
//! with a five-hour limit barely touched.

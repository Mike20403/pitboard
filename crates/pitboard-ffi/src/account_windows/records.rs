//! The account windows' records: the stores each Pitboard directory made, and the page each of
//! its windows was last on. The model keeps them in `windows.json`, in a directory of the
//! app's own that the app names in `AppLaunch::windows`, since the web stores they describe
//! are the app's whichever Pitboard directory it serves: WebKit keeps every store of one app
//! under the person's own Library, whatever `HOME` says. Inside, each directory's records
//! are kept apart, under the key the app gives it, so a copy of the app run with another home
//! never takes the installed copy's stores for its own.
//!
//! The macOS app kept these in UserDefaults, as `webStores` and `windowPages`, by the same
//! keys, with each store id in upper case, as Foundation writes a UUID: WebsiteData.swift's
//! `StoreRecord` and `PageRecord`, as they were at a3e5ce0. It hands what it held over once,
//! as `AppLaunch`'s `EarlierWindowRecords`, the way it hands over its earlier preferences.
//! A store id is compared without regard to case wherever it comes from: read as written,
//! every store the macOS app recorded would be taken for an orphan, and deleted with the
//! sign-in it holds.
//!
//! What is here is pure: it reads the file's text as the lane read it, and says what to write.

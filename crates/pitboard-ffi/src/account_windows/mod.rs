//! The rules of an account's window on its site, for both apps: which accounts have a window
//! and which store keeps each one's data, where a page may go, what a window says, what a
//! download is called, and what a page may do. Each app's web code asks them as its engine
//! asks it, WebKit on macOS and WebView2 on Windows, on its main thread: each answers at once
//! from what it is given, and only `download_destination` looks at the file system.
//!
//! What follows the app's reads is the model's, in `model/windows.rs`: which windows close
//! and which stores go after a read, the records of stores and last pages, which `records.rs`
//! reads and writes, the links waiting for a window, the account picker and the downloads.
//!
//! What differs by system is a `match` on `host::OS`, as the core's facts about the system
//! are, so a system added there does not compile until each is said for it. Each such fact
//! takes the system as an argument, so the tests say every system's on any of them.

/// The app is made of the platform's own parts: a menu, a window with a sidebar, sheets,
/// grouped forms and alerts. What is decided here is only what those parts do not decide
/// themselves, so it is said once rather than by every view:
///
/// - Type: the system's text styles and nothing else. A name is `.body`, what describes it
///   is `.callout` or `.subheadline` in `.secondary`, figures are monospaced digits so a
///   column of percentages does not shift as they change.
/// - Colour: the system's semantic colours. Colour only ever repeats something a word or a
///   shape already says, because not everybody sees it.
/// - Symbols: SF Symbols, one per meaning, named here.
/// - Space: the platform's default padding and spacing, and the few measures below where a
///   component lays itself out.
